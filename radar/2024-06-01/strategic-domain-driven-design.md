With the increasing complexity of software systems, Strategic Domain-Driven Design has become more and more important. Aligning software design with business needs through tactical and strategic patterns has proven invaluable, especially in the era of microservices and Agile methodologies.

In addition, new tools and techniques have emerged that support the practical application of Strategic Domain-Driven Design, such as:

* **Core Domain Charts**: Introduced by Eric Evans in 2019, these support the identification and prioritization of core business domains, ensuring that critical areas receive appropriate focus and resources.
* **Event Storming**: A popular workshop format for collaboratively exploring complex domains, facilitating a shared understanding and uncovering domain insights.
* **Wardley Maps**: Created by Simon Wardley, these are a visualization tool that helps organizations understand their business landscape, anticipate change, and identify strategic opportunities.

The continuing relevance of Eric Evans' *Domain-Driven Design*, more than 20 years after the book was first published, underscores its importance in modern software development.
