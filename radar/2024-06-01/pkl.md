[PKL](https://pkl-lang.org/) -- pronounced Pickle -- is a configuration language created by Apple. It provides rich support for data templating
and validation and can be used, simply from commandline, integrated into build-pipelines or embedded into programs. PKL
also provides some tooling around package-management, which makes it easy to split up bigger project into packages or
just consume packages that are already out there.

Available PKL packages and docs can be found [here](https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/).

At AOE we are using pkl currently for generation of different kinds of DevOps resources like Gitlab-CI
Pipelines or Kubernetes resources, but this might change.
