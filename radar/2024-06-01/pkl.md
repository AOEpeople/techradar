PKL -- pronounced Pickle -- is a configuration language created by Apple. It provides rich support for data templating
and validation and can be used, simply from commandline, integrated into build-pipelines or embedded into programs.

At AOE we are using pkl currently for generation of different kinds of DevOps resources like Gitlab-CI 
Pipelines or Kubernetes resources, but this might change.
