[PKL](https://pkl-lang.org/) -- pronounced Pickle -- is a configuration language created by Apple. It provides rich support for data templating and validation and can be used simply from the command line, integrated into build pipelines, or embedded into programs. PKL also provides some tooling around package management, which makes it easy to split up bigger projects into packages or just consume packages that are already out there.

Available PKL packages and docs can be found [here](https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/).

At AOE, we are currently using PKL for the generation of different kinds of DevOps resources like GitLab CI pipelines or Kubernetes resources, but this might change.
