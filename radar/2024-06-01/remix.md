With Remix v2.2.0 Remix itself is now just a Vite plugin. This gives us access to the entire ecosystem of Vite plugins and even more, for example:

- **Near-instant dev startup.** Vite lazily compiles your app code on-demand, so the dev server can boot immediately.
- **Pre-bundled dependencies.** Vite only processes dependencies once, so large libraries like Material UI and AntD donâ€™t become bottlenecks for rebuilds nor hot updates.
- **Incremental hot updates.** Vite keeps track of dependencies so it only needs to reprocess app code that depends on the changes.
