The [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (OAS) is a broadly adopted industry standard for describing modern REST APIs. Other initiatives like RAML have [joined](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/open-api-raml-better-together/) the OpenAPI Initiative.

**OpenAPI v3**

The current version, OpenAPI v3, added more features to the specification, for example, the ability to describe APIs supporting request/callback patterns.

There is a very good API designer: [Apicurio](https://www.apicur.io/) and a good mock generator: [Microcks](http://microcks.github.io/).

The general tool support is excellent. See [OpenAPI Tools](https://openapi.tools/).

**TM Forum Open API**

The TeleManagement Forum (TM Forum) has introduced its own set of Open APIs to foster interoperability and standardization within the telecommunications industry. The TM Forum Open API initiative provides a suite of REST-based APIs designed to accelerate the digital transformation of service providers and their ecosystem partners. These APIs cover a wide range of business scenarios and operational areas, such as customer management, product management, and service activation.

The TM Forum's Open API specifications aim to ensure that diverse systems can interoperate seamlessly, promoting agility and reducing integration costs. The comprehensive documentation and resources provided by TM Forum are instrumental in helping organizations adopt and implement these APIs effectively.

- [TM Forum Open API Specifications](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/API/Open+API+Table)
- [TM Forum GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tmforum-apis)

These additions from TM Forum further enhance the value of the OpenAPI Specification by providing industry-specific standards that help streamline telecommunications operations.
