[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) is a feature-rich and highly versatile [CSS-in-JS](/methods-and-patterns/css-in-js/) library that generates CSS at build time. It provides a great developer experience without the disadvantages of runtime libraries. It is framework-agnostic, but unlike [Stylex](/languages-and-frameworks/stylex/) and Vanilla Extract, it provides JSX-specific features like the `styled` function and style props on top of it.

### Key Features:
- Compatible with [React Server Components](/methods-and-patterns/react-server-components/)
- No performance disadvantages compared to runtime libraries
- Highly versatile:
  - Recipes and variants like Stitches
  - Framework-agnostic
  - `styled` function to create UI components like Stitches
  - Style props like styled-system
  - Utility classes like Tailwind
- W3C-compliant design system with tokens and utilities support
- Fully typed API

With comprehensive documentation and great community support from the Chakra UI Team, we see a lot of potential for it to become one of the best CSS-in-JS libraries in the future.
