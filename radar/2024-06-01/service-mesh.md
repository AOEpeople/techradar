Service Meshes are part of all our Kubernetes implementations now.
We value the additional security features they provide to our platforms.

We are using [Istio](https://istio.io/) on multiple production clusters
and are assessing [Cillium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/network/servicemesh/)
as it also improves on Kubernetes' NetworkPolicies. We also consider [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io)
a good candidate when looking for a Service Mesh for your project.
