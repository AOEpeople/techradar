[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is a open source, community driven fork of terraform in response to HashiCorps license changes. It's terraform 1.6 compatible and can act as a drop-in replacement. We watch development and ecosystem growth closely and evaluate a move from terraform to OpenTofu in some projects.
