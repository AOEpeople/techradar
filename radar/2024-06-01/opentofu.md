[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is an open-source, community-driven fork of [Terraform](/platforms-and-aoe-services/terraform/) in response to HashiCorp's license changes. It's Terraform 1.6 compatible and can act as a drop-in replacement. We watch development and ecosystem growth closely and evaluate a move from Terraform to OpenTofu in some projects.
