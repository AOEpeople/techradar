[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is an all-in-one toolkit for Javascript and Typescript environments. It includes a JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner and Node.js compatible package manager.
It is designed to optimise the performance and development experience of JavaScript and TypeScript applications. Bun provides fast startup times, native TypeScript support, and improved dependency management.

We are very curious whether "bun" is suitable for our projects and fulfils our requirements with regard to professional environments.
