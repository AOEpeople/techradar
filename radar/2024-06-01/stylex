Facebook has released the open source [StyleX] (https://stylexjs.com/). A new styling library that takes the developer experience of [CSS-in-JS](https://www.aoe.com/techradar/methods-and-patterns/css-in-js/)libraries and combines it with the performance and scalability of static CSS using compile-time tools. It is scalable, predictable, composable, fast, and type-safe.

We are very excited to see whether StyleX is suitable for our projects
