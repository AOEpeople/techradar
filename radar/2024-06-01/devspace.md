[DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/) is an open-source developer tool for Kubernetes that lets you develop and deploy cloud-native software faster. As a "client-only" development tool, it is very simple to develop Kubernetes-native applications in local or any remote cluster.

- **Build**, test, and debug applications directly inside Kubernetes.
- **Develop** with hot reloading: updates your running containers without rebuilding images or restarting containers.
- **Unify** deployment workflows within your team and across dev, staging, and production.
- **Automate** repetitive tasks for image building and deployment.
- **Hot-Reloading** allows to recompile and restart Pods in local or remote clusters.
