As digitalization accelerates, the energy consumption of IT systems continues to increase. Data centers, network infrastructures, and client devices collectively account for a growing share of global electricity demand. In response, Green IT has emerged as a discipline focused on reducing the environmental impact of digital systems across architecture, development, and operations.

### Sustainable Software Practices
Sustainable software development requires consideration of environmental impacts throughout the entire lifecycle:
- **Modular and lean design**: Build only what is needed. Modular architectures support reuse and allow for the independent deployment and scaling of components.
- **Energy-aware programming**: Choose languages and runtimes with low resource overhead. For compute-bound workloads, compiled languages such as [Rust](/languages-and-frameworks/rust/) or [Go](/languages-and-frameworks/go-lang/) typically consume less energy during execution.
- **Demand shaping and workload scheduling**: Align compute-intensive jobs with times of renewable energy availability, especially in non-interactive and batch-processing contexts.
- **Avoid overprovisioning**: Shut down idle components. Use [infrastructure as code](/methods-and-patterns/infrastructure-as-code/) and autoscaling to allocate only the resources required.
- **Green hosting**: Prefer cloud regions or providers powered by renewable energy, and prioritize those that provide CO₂ transparency.
- **Hardware and software longevity**: Design systems that avoid unnecessary hardware churn, extending their lifespan through thoughtful design and maintenance.

### Metrics and Measurement
Environmental metrics help teams identify hotspots and track progress over time:
- **Operational energy consumption**: CPU time, memory usage, network I/O, and idle time
- **Embodied carbon**: Emissions associated with the manufacturing and lifecycle of development and runtime hardware
- **CO₂ emissions per unit of work**: Emissions per request, transaction, or user session

### Architecture Patterns for Sustainable Systems
Well-architected systems can significantly reduce environmental impact:
- **Event-driven and reactive systems**: Enable on-demand processing and eliminate resource-intensive polling
- **Serverless and FaaS**: Promote short-lived, minimal compute and better resource utilization
- **Edge computing**: Reduces latency and data transfer, especially in IoT and real-time scenarios

### Avoiding the Rebound Effect
Efficiency does not automatically lead to sustainability. Improvements can be offset by increased usage, a phenomenon known as the rebound effect. Reducing energy per request is only effective when combined with conscious decisions about system scale, feature scope, and usage patterns.

### Digitalization as Leverage for Sustainability
When used deliberately, digitalization can reduce environmental impact:
- **Demand-driven production**: Minimizes overproduction and waste using real-time data
- **Digital product passports**: Improve transparency and traceability in supply chains
- **Smart infrastructure**: Enables intelligent control and optimization of energy usage in buildings, logistics, and manufacturing

### A Greener Future for IT
Green IT is not just a technical initiative, it is a design principle and strategic commitment. However, achieving comprehensive sustainability is a complex task. It compels us to make conscientious choices at every stage of the software development lifecycle. Long term, Green IT creates not only ecological but also economic value, positioning organizations to meet regulatory, customer, and societal expectations.
