Node.js is one of our preferred backend technologies.

When compared to <a href="kotlin.html">Kotlin</a> we prefer to use Node.js when:

- You want to get started quickly with little overhead. Kotlin projects tend to have somewhat more
  overhead in setting things up, also with regards to the JVM runtime that is used.
- Full-stack development is important. E.g. for smaller projects where developers need to be
  full-stack, Node.js would generally be preferred since Node.js developers can relatively easily do
  frontend development as well, both being JavaScript based.
- Doing serverless development. Node.js is more often used in this area compared to Kotlin and fits
  better with our preferred serverless frameworks
