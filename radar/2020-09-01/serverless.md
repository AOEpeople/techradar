We use the [AWS definition of serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/):
"Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your
operational responsibilities to AWS, increasing your agility and innovation. Serverless allows you
to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.

At INFO we prefer a serverless architecture (over other architectures like microservices) for most
new client solutions, depending on requirements, potential constraints as well available expertise (
more detailed reasoning will be added later), because of increased agility and time-to-market. A
combination of a serverless and (cloud-native) microservice/container architecture is also a viable
option in many cases.
