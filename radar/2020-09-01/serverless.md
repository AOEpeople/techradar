We prefer a serverless architecture (over other architectures like <a href="microservices.html">microservices</a>) for most
new client solutions, depending on requirements, potential constraints as well available expertise, 
because of increased agility and time-to-market. A combination of a serverless and
microservice architecture is also a viable option in many cases.

Serverless is often combined with an <a href="event-driven-architecture.html">event-driven architecture</a>.

We use the [AWS definition of serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/):

"Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your
operational responsibilities to AWS (..or a different cloud vendor..), increasing your agility and innovation.
Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers."
