In the context of the infrastructure and architecture for new client solutions at INFO, facing
market-conform requirements for fast time-to-market, high agility and pay-per-use costs, we prefer a
vendor-specific cloud-native (<a href="aws">Amazon AWS</a> or <a href="azure">Microsoft Azure</a>) 
solution over traditional on-premise or hybrid solutions (while still offering such solutions when 
there is a good reason), to achieve faster time-to-market, more agility and lower costs (depending on usage) 
because of the ability to use many out-of-the-box cloud vendor services, accepting a vendor lock-in towards the cloud
provider, because some cloud services that will be used are specific to the cloud vendor in
question.
