In the context of developing user interfaces for the web, facing a plethora of libraries and frameworks to create these user interfaces, we decided for React and neglected other libraries/frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, Svelte, jQuery and others, to achieve a preferred open source front-end library based on web technologies, accepting limiting our ability to work effectively on existing user interfaces for the web built using other libraries/frameworks, because React provides us with a uniform way of working with a proven mature technology, tool chain and extensive (community) resources that is portable to mobile development.
