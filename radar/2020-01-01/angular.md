Angular, commonly referred to as "AngularJS" or "Angular 1," is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework originally developed by Google. It is designed to simplify and streamline the process of building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and provides a structured approach to organizing and developing client-side code.

Key features and characteristics of Angular (AngularJS) include:

1. **MVC Architecture:** Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps developers separate concerns in their applications. In Angular, the model represents data, the view handles the user interface, and the controller manages interactions and logic.

2. **Two-Way Data Binding:** Angular offers two-way data binding, allowing automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view. Changes in the model are reflected in the view, and vice versa, without requiring manual updates.

3. **HTML Templates:** Angular uses HTML templates as the basis for defining the user interface of web applications. These templates can include dynamic expressions, directives, and data binding to create dynamic and interactive views.

4. **Directives:** Directives are a fundamental feature of Angular that extend HTML with custom attributes and behaviors. They allow developers to create reusable components and add functionality to HTML elements.

5. **Dependency Injection:** Angular includes a robust dependency injection system that promotes modularity and testability by making it easy to manage and inject dependencies into components and services.

6. **Routing:** Angular provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to create SPAs with multiple views and navigation between them. This is particularly useful for building complex web applications.

7. **Services:** Angular services are used to encapsulate and share business logic, data retrieval, and other common functionality across components. They are singleton objects that can be injected into various parts of an application.

8. **Testing:** Angular is designed with testing in mind, and it provides tools and techniques for writing unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of applications.

9. **Internationalization (i18n):** Angular includes features for building applications that support multiple languages and locales, making it suitable for globalized web applications.

10. **Community and Ecosystem:** Angular has a large and active community of developers, as well as a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, extensions, and tools to enhance the development process.
