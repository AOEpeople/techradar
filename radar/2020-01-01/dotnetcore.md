.NET Core, now known as .NET 5 and later .NET 6 (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021), is an open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft. It is used for building and running modern applications, including web applications, APIs, microservices, desktop applications, and more. .NET Core was initially introduced as a reimagined and cross-platform version of the traditional .NET Framework, with a focus on performance, modularity, and support for a wide range of platforms.

Key characteristics and features of .NET Core include:

1. **Cross-Platform:** .NET Core is designed to work on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This cross-platform compatibility enables developers to write code on one platform and run it on another without major modifications.

2. **Open Source:** .NET Core is fully open source, with its source code available on GitHub. This allows the developer community to contribute to its development, report issues, and build custom features.

3. **Performance:** .NET Core is optimized for high performance and includes features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and a modern runtime. It's suitable for building high-performance applications, including web servers, APIs, and microservices.

4. **Modularity:** The framework is designed to be modular, allowing developers to include only the necessary libraries and dependencies for their applications. This reduces the size of applications and improves their maintainability.

5. **Unified Platform:** With the introduction of .NET 5 and later .NET 6, Microsoft aimed to unify the .NET ecosystem. .NET 5 brought together the best features of .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin, making it a comprehensive platform for various application types.

6. **Support for Multiple Programming Languages:** .NET Core supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their project.

7. **Tooling:** .NET Core comes with a rich set of development tools, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface), making it accessible and productive for developers.

8. **Containerization:** .NET Core applications are well-suited for containerization using technologies like Docker, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in containerized environments.

9. **Web Development:** ASP.NET Core, a part of .NET Core, is a modern web framework for building web applications and APIs. It provides features for building scalable, high-performance web applications.

10. **Desktop Development:** With .NET 5 and later, you can use .NET to build cross-platform desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux using technologies like WinUI and MAUI (Multi-platform App UI).
