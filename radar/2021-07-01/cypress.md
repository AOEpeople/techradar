[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has proven itself in AOE projects. With its support for JavaScript and TypeScript, Cypress is a testing tool
that strongly resonates with front-end developers. It is very easy to adopt, and the test specifications are easy to
implement and maintain. Test execution is swift, and the results are well-documented, understandable, and easy to
publish, for example, via GitLab Pages.

Currently, it supports Chrome, Firefox, and Electron.
