Angular ships as a fully integrated development platform from scaffolding, code generation, routing, guarding, unit/e2e-testing, multi-language builds (i18n) and stable dev/build processes and keeping it extensible at the same time.
This holistic nature of Angular makes it in the beginning way more difficult to learn but once understood it's a great candidate to go very fast into "requirement implementation" aka providing early value rather than library wiring.
Beside the existing telco-industry projects we've actually also chosen Angular for resource critical industry 4.0 / embedded projects.
Here we've selected Angular beside the performance aspects to fulfill requirements like adaptive multi device support (custom hardware buttons, tablets and laptops) on the one hand and on the other hand to reduce the risk loosing time by having too many self-managed external dependencies.

Angular in version 15 remains a robust and well maintained frontend framework that keeps building new features on its strong foundation. Angular provides excellent tools for building large scale applications. It comes for example with the built-in capabilities to setup and manage a monorepo. This makes sharing componentes over multiple projects very straight forward. Angular as a framework provides an opinionated approach to solve various problems, reduces decision making in a positive way and offers consistency, while still offering enough flexibility where its needed. Angular 15 stabilizes standalone components, a feature introduced in Angular 14, that aims towards further simplifying Angular applications. This reduces module complexity which is a common criticism towards Angular. Upgrading to new versions has become quite easy due to the stable nature of the framework and detailed migration guides provided by the maintainers.
