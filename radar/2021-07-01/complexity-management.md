How can IT organizations deal with the growing complexity of innovation, transformation, and cross-functional collaboration? This article introduces key perspectives from systems thinking and complexity management to improve communication and decision-making.

## Intro
Our world is increasingly complex - our society and the economic system is developing fast - we constantly have to deal with surprises and uncertainty. Especially IT organizations working in cross-functional innovation and transformation contexts face this challenge daily. This is a reason why many projects fail.

## Multidimensional thinking in software architecture

IT organizations are complex socio-technical systems. In complex systems, architecture decisions are never purely technical – they are acts of communication. That’s why communication quality is directly linked to architecture quality.

Architecture decisions are context-specific and involve numerous interrelated dimensions and sometimes conflicting goals. Recognizing, differentiating, deviating, and handling these aspects are crucial in communication and decision-making. 

Some key dimensions, perspectives to consider:

Business model, domain and strategy
- Product, market, and investment strategy and theses
- Existing enterprise architecture landscape
- Parallel initiatives and projects
- Operation goals and KPIs

Organizational aspects
- Team topology, roles, skills, and hierarchy
- Internal processes 
- Culture and decision-making mechanisms
- Partner network and access to skills

Technical requirements and constraints
- Performance, data volume, traffic, etc.
- Security, compliance, and data privacy
- Existing solutions, tools, and standard products


## What is Complexity – and How to Manage It

Something is complex, when it is not possible to relate all its elements at the same time. There is no clear cause and result relationship. Decision making processes cannot be well structured.

But this should not be used as an excuse. Instead, it should motivate us to build the capability to deal with complexity – collaboratively, creatively and consciously.

Complexity management capabilities describe the ability to deal with complexity. The more different dimensions are used to observe and analyse a situation, the higher they are differenciated and the faster this is done - the better complexity is managed.

The complexity in IT initiatives and projects comes from the uncertainties of how a product is adopted by the users and the market, the nearly endless choices of technical ingredients, the team and organisational structures and the established collaboration and communication etc.

Agile methods and other best practices evolved from that challenges - and are now widely adopted - but without proper reflection and complexity management they can also lead to dysfunctional communication patterns.

Since we are solving problems in collaboration we also need to deal with the complexity of the communication system (social system):

* We are often seeing how large and historical organizations have a hard time with their transformation initiatives. 
* Some teams develop dysfunctional patterns over time, making collaboration and clarity difficult. 
* We see teams where no clear communication is established and where the important conflicts are not addressed.
* We see teams that argue one-dimensional and spend time and energy in useless debates.
* We see organizations that are full of internal orientation and activities - while they are losing the connection to the external customers and market.

An understanding of how communication systems are working - and what conditions for working communication (and therefore collaboration) exist, helps to address such situations better. It also helps to understand how we can use conflicts for creativity (creating new perspectives and ideas).

That includes the awareness that we can always learn from each other! 

That is the reason we see systemic perspectives with proper system theoretical background emerging in the space of organisational development. We believe that proper learning of these perspectives and the awareness of complexity management capabilities can help organizations to form functional collaboration. This learning helps to reflect systems and oneself more conscious - and that can be a healthy condition for more impact and learning. It may also help that an organisation does not blindly follow the next model, agile "hype" or consultant promises.
