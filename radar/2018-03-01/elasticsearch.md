We are continuing to use Elasticsearch successfully in [SearchperienceÂ®](http://www.searchperience.com/) and have benefited from the aggregation features for related use cases such as rendering category trees. We also use Elasticsearch as a persistence solution for various microservices.

This is why we have updated its status to **adopt**.
