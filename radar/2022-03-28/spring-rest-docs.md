[Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs/) auto generates [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) snippets with the help of [Spring MVC Test](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle#spring-mvc-test-framework) or [RestAssured](/tools/rest-assured/).
So you can be sure that your tests are inline with the documentation.

We now use an Api First approach in conjunction with [Open API](/tools/open-api/). We see an active community there and a lot of support with this approach.
