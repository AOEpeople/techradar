ZeroTrust is a paradigm where no trust is assumed inside a known network, frameworks such as Google's BeyondCorp are build upon that pattern.
With the surge of cloud technologies and micro services the network perimeter is ever disappearing. 
This provides challenges for authentication of subjects that used to heavily rely on network segments.
With Zero Trust no assumption is made about how far something can be trusted, everything is untrusted by default and authentication and authorisation happens all the time, not just once.
While network segments and VPN connections may still have relevance in specific areas AOE is increasingly implementing BeyondCorp in all its components and services with implementing OAuth and OpenID Connect.
