Ever since there are recurring discussions about the version control strategy that a team should use.

At AOE, we have also made the experience that when new teams start off using blocking or long-lived feature branches (merging late once all review comments are done), it has a negative impact on team performance.

We recommend using trunk-based development with short-lived (<1 day) feature branches because this has shown to support continuous integration and team collaboration the best. However, we do accept teams' choices to use GitFlow; we just do not try to encourage them in the first place.
