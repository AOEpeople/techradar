[Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) is a collaborative workshop method for exploring and modeling complex business domains through domain events.

Rather than starting with abstract requirements, Event Storming begins with concrete events and works backward to identify what triggered them and who was involved. This retrospective approach reveals cause-and-effect relationships, clarifies responsibilities, and highlights gaps or risks early in the process.

Event Storming supports the key principles of Domain-Driven Design. It helps teams establish a ubiquitous language, define aggregates and bounded contexts, and understand the interactions between actors, commands, and domain events. These insights inform service boundaries, technical design, and architectural decisions, especially in event-driven systems that use patterns such as CQRS and event sourcing.

Workshops use a shared modeling surface, either physical or digital, to capture the timeline of a process. Participants identify domain events, commands, actors, aggregates, read models, policies, external systems, and areas of uncertainty (hot spots). This process accelerates shared understanding, improves collaboration, and helps teams navigate complexity with clarity and purpose.
