A primary goal of software development organizations is to improve the performance of software delivery and operations.

There are a lot of best practices and also different opinions on how to do "devops the right way".
We have learned that IT organizations and software delivery are complex issues. This means that most of the time there are no "easy" answers: Instead, contextual continuous improvement is a critical element.

To bring more objectivity and some form of verifiability into this, we like to use the four key metrics suggested by "The state of devops" and "DORA". These four key metrics are

**To evaluate velocity:**
- Deployment Frequency (How often a team successfully deploys to production, e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Lead time for changes (the average time it takes to deploy a commit to production)

**To evaluate stability:**
- Time to Restore Services (For a failure, the median time between the deployment that caused the failure and the remediation)
- Change Failure Rate (The number of failures per number of deployments)

## About DORA
The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) is the largest and longest-running research program of its kind, seeking to understand the capabilities driving software delivery and operations performance. Their report "The State of DevOps" regularly provides insights, observations, and relationships of IT organizations deemed "high performing".
