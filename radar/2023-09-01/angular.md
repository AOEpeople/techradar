Angular in version 15 remains a robust and well maintained frontend framework that keeps building new features on its strong foundation. Angular provides excellent tools for building large scale applications. 
It comes for example with the built-in capabilities to setup and manage a monorepo. This makes sharing componentes over multiple projects very straight forward. Angular as a framework provides an opinionated approach to solve various problems, 
reduces decision making in a positive way and offers consistency, while still offering enough flexibility where its needed. Angular 15 stabilizes standalone components, a feature introduced in Angular 14, that aims towards further simplifying Angular applications. 
This reduces module complexity which is a common criticism towards Angular. 
Upgrading to new versions has become quite easy due to the stable nature of the framework and detailed migration guides provided by the maintainers.
