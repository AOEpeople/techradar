Angular in version 15 remains a robust and well-maintained front-end framework that continues to build new features on its strong foundation. Angular provides excellent tools for building large-scale applications.

For example, it comes with the built-in ability to set up and manage a monorepo. This makes sharing components across multiple projects very straightforward. Angular as a framework provides an opinionated approach to solving various problems,
reduces decision making in a positive way and provides consistency while still offering enough flexibility where it is needed. Angular 15 stabilizes standalone components, a feature introduced in Angular 14 that aims to further simplify Angular applications.
This reduces module complexity, which is a common criticism of Angular.

Upgrading to new versions has become quite easy due to the stable nature of the framework and detailed migration guides provided by the maintainers.
