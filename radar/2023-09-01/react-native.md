[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is an open-source UI software framework used to build applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows, and UWP by allowing developers to use the React framework along with native platform features.

Developing applications with a single code base can help ensure consistent user experiences across platforms, with the performance advantages of native code.
