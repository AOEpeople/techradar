As modern browsers nowadays allow native usage of [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) it is possible to use it for improving frontend development which is the goal of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).
Since it's announcement in 2020, Vite picked up a lot of attention and was able to grow a large community providing pluggable features. 
Vite brings two things, a native ESM based dev-server and a bundler for production builds.
The dev-server features an improved performance during development as modules are loaded and transpiled only on demand. This leads to faster cold-start times and quicker HMR.
We see Vite as a stable and production ready tool, and would recommend it for upcoming projects.
