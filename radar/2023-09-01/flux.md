In the early days of [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react.html), [Flux](https://github.com/facebookarchive/flux) was
introduced by Facebook as an architectural pattern for managing global state.
Later, it was also developed as a library along with others from the community.

There are now a number of libraries that offer the Flux pattern or similar approaches to state management.
Among them are framework-agnostic solutions like [Redux](/languages-and-frameworks/redux.html) or [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html),
but also framework-specific ones like [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) (Vue), [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand) (React) and many others.

One of the most popular solutions so far is Redux, which is why we use it in several projects.
