[Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) is a progressive, incrementally adoptable framework for building user interfaces, known for its simplicity and flexibility. The core library is view-focused, making it easy to integrate with other libraries and existing projects. It excels in powering single-page applications when combined with supporting libraries like [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org), [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org) and [VueUse](https://vueuse.org), but can also be used for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications with the [Nuxt framework](https://nuxt.com).

The HTML-based template syntax in Vue allows for declarative binding of the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance's data, which, in combination with the [reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html), ensures high performance by intelligently determining the minimal amount of components to re-render and applying the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app-state changes. Additionally, applications can be organized into [Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html), each containing the template (HTML), style (CSS), and functionality (JS). The [Composition API and 'script setup'](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html)-syntax further enhance code readability and modularity, promoting reusability and maintainability throughout the development process.

Vue brings powerful features, such as Teleport, allowing components to render at any position on the page, and Fragment, which removes the requirement for a single root element in a template. Additionally, Vue delivers enhanced performance through Tree-Shaking, reducing bundle size and Compiler-informed Virtual DOM optimizations, leading to faster initial renders and updates while consuming less memory.
