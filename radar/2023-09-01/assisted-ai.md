In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made monumental strides, and AI has demonstrated its ability to augment human capabilities and enhance user experiences. One noteworthy facet of this evolution is Assisted AIâ€”a paradigm that holds great promise for software development companies.

Assisted AI combines human and machine intelligence to enhance productivity. It leverages AI's computational capabilities while preserving human critical thinking.

### Advantages and Opportunities

Developers should consider using generative artificial intelligence (AI) for a multitude of reasons:

- **Code Enhancement**: Assisted AI offers intelligent code suggestions, optimizing and refactoring. It helps saving time and boosting quality and developer satisfaction.
- **Automated Testing**: It accelerates testing, identifies bugs, and generates test cases for more robust, reliable software.
- **NLP-powered Documentation**: Assisted AI assists in writing precise, comprehensive documentation.
- **Security**: Assisted AI can help identifying vulnerabilities.
