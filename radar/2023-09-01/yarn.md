We decided to move Yarn to the adopt ring as it has continued to establish itself in the last years and has successfully 
been used in many of our projects. It continues to offer better performance than npm and in addition offers both 
offline installation and the Plug'n'Play approach. With Plug'n'Play mode Yarn replaces the node_modules directory 
with a virtual filesystem in order to improve performance and save disk space. Yarn is a good choice for monorepos 
due to the support of workspaces and is absolutely recommended as a package manager.
