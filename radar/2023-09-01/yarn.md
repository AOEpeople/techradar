Yarn has continued to establish itself not only with the release of Yarn 2 in 2020. It continues to offer better 
performance than npm and in addition offers both offline installation and the new plug'n'play approach. Yarn is 
a good choice for monorepos due to the support of workspaces and is absolutely recommended as a package manager.
