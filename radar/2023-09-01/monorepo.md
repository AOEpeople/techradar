### Why We Consider a Monorepo Approach

Adopting a monorepo approach for our React and Next.js-based projects offers several benefits, _although it may not be
the best fit for every project._

1. More efficient code sharing and reusability
2. Consistent Development Environment
3. Easier Cross-project Refactoring
4. Improved Collaboration
5. **Simplified Dependency Management**: In our monorepo, we can manage dependencies at the repository level, which can
   simplify the process of keeping everything up to date and avoiding version conflicts.
6. **Streamlined CI/CD Pipeline**: A single CI/CD pipeline that can build and test all our projects simultaneously.
   This of course comes with the drawback of a more complicated CI/CD setup and probably longer running pipelines.
7. **Better Code Ownership**: It's easier to see who is responsible for each part of the codebase, which can help
   improve code ownership and accountability.
8. **Simplified Testing**: We can set up end-to-end tests and integration tests that cover the entire application more
   easily in a monorepo, ensuring that changes in one part of the codebase don't break other parts.
9. **Codebase Navigation**: Developers can easily navigate through different parts of the codebase without having to
   switch between multiple repositories or projects.

**However, it is important to note that monorepos are not a one-size-fits-all solution.** They can introduce complexity,
especially in very large projects, and may not be suitable for all team sizes or development workflows. The decision to
adopt a monorepo should be based on careful consideration of your project's specific requirements, team size, and
development practices.
