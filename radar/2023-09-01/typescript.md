Typescript has become more widely used and has become the industry standard for most JavaScript projects. 
Typescript brings all the means to avoid errors in development, refactor code, scale projects, and improve 
code collaboration. Its widespread use and large community help to further improve and document the language. 
Typescript is our language of choice for existing and future projects to write robust and clean JavaScript code.
