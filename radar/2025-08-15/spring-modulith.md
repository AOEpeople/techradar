[Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith) is a framework designed to support modular monolithic architectures, aligning perfectly with the [Modulith First](/methods-and-patterns/modulith-first/) approach. Built on top of the Spring ecosystem, it provides tools to enforce modular boundaries, promote clean architecture, and simplify the transition to microservices if needed.

Spring Modulith builds on [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/), a library for testing architectural constraints in Java applications. Its seamless integration with the Spring ecosystem makes it an easy adoption for teams already familiar with [Spring Boot](/languages-and-frameworks/spring-boot/).

The event-driven communication model helps decouple modules through domain events, while the module verification feature detects cyclic dependencies and ensures that modules adhere to defined boundaries.

However, adopting Spring Modulith requires a disciplined approach to modular design. Teams must invest time in defining clear module boundaries and consistently enforce them throughout the development lifecycle.
