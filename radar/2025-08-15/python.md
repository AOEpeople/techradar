[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Designed with an emphasis on code readability and developer productivity, it was first released in 1991. Over the years, Python has evolved into one of the most widely used programming languages, supported by a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Its adaptability to various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, and automation, has made it a cornerstone of modern software engineering. Python's strong community support ensures continuous improvement and a wealth of learning resources.

At AOE, Python has proven to be an effective tool in various contexts. It is widely used for automation tasks such as CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure management, leveraging tools like [Ansible](/platforms-and-aoe-services/ansible/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). In data-driven projects, libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) have enabled efficient data processing and machine learning workflows. Python's simplicity and readability also make it an excellent choice for [scripting and glue code](/platforms-and-aoe-services/python-for-infrastructure/) in complex systems.

While Python excels in many areas, its performance may not be ideal for tasks that require high computational efficiency. In such cases, we recommend using optimized libraries implemented in C or integrating Python with other languages designed for performance-critical workloads, such as [Go](/languages-and-frameworks/go-lang/).
