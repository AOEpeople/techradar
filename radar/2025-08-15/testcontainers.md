Application testing often involves external resources, such as databases, message brokers, and other services. Manually managing these dependencies can lead to inconsistencies and unreliable test results. [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) addresses this problem by automating the creation and teardown of lightweight, disposable, containers for testing purposes. Testcontainers seamlessly integrates with Docker to create isolated environments for running tests, ensuring consistency and reliability across different development setups.

At AOE, Testcontainers has proven to be a valuable tool for integration testing projects with complex service architectures. It easily complements popular testing frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG. With Testcontainers, developers can define containerized services directly in their test code, simplifying the setup and teardown of dependencies as part of the test lifecycle.

We recommend Testcontainers for projects involving microservices or distributed systems, where testing the interactions between components is critical. While not being a replacement for unit testing, it complements existing testing strategies by providing a reliable way to validate integrations.
