We have summarized the practices of pair programming and administrating as pair working.

Derived as a practice from eXtreme Programming (XP), pair programming is a practice that aims for fine-grained feedback within a team.

At AOE, some developers and operators work in pairs, not constantly, but from time to time. Most teams have positive experiences using this method, but not all teams have tried the by-the-book approach (e.g., driver/navigator pattern). Especially for non-trivial tasks, pair working leads to rapid knowledge sharing and better results with fewer bugs. We encourage the teams to try this approach more often.

By incorporating pair working into regular routines, teams can improve collaboration and boost productivity. In addition, this practice can help foster a culture of continuous learning and mutual support within the organization.
