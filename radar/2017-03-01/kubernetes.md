Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that supports many infrastructure providers. It enables you to deploy containers and manages the running, scaling, or self-healing of your applications based on configurations you provide. It is built on years of knowledge and experience gained by Google through its use of containers.

At AOE, we initially implemented Kubernetes in a test environment on bare metal to experiment with its capabilities. Currently, it is utilized for running internal AOE applications such as dashboards and for running builds in containers. We have also begun using it for upcoming projects to manage several services. There are tools available to automate the setup of Kubernetes in AWS, such as [Cops](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kops/). Another helpful tool is [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), which allows for testing and running Kubernetes locally.
