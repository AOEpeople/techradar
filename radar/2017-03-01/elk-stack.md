The [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/de/elastic-stack) is a powerful trio of tools that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for logging, searching, visualizing, and analyzing data in real time:

- **[Elasticsearch](/platforms-and-aoe-services/elasticsearch/)**: A search and analytics engine that indexes and stores data.
- **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests and transforms various data formats.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool that creates interactive dashboards and reports.

In today's complex IT environments, having a centralized logging solution is essential. It allows you to:
- Gain a unified view of system activities.
- Detect correlations between different events more easily.
- Extract valuable KPIs and visualize them on customizable dashboards.

At AOE, we have been using the ELK Stack for years in various projects and infrastructure setups. It has proven invaluable for visualizing traffic, tracking KPIs, and analyzing application logs. We highly recommend that all teams adopt this solution and focus on generating meaningful logs in their applications.
