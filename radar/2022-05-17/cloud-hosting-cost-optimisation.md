We believe that cloud hosting cost optimisation should be a continuous and integral part of our way of working, both
in active projects and in platforms under maintenance, in which case it should be part of the
SLA. Cloud vendors offer extensive tooling in this area which should be used for this purpose. Also
consider using an architectural fitness function (<a href="">Evolutionary Architectures'</a>) for
optimising the run-cost. In some exceptional cases it could even be considered to change the hosting
architecture / platform altogether.
