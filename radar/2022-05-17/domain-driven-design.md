Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a
domain according to input from that domain's experts.

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
- basing complex designs on a model of the domain
- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a
conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
