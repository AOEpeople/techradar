We prefer GitHub as source code management and CI solution. 

Background:

In the context of consolidating where possible on a source code management and Continuous
Integration solution for our software projects, facing suboptimal experiences with Bitbucket Cloud,
Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit, we decided to prefer GitHub Enterprise for new projects because it
offers the best set of features for the price, is the market leader in this area and solves the
issues we came across using the other vendor solutions, accepting that we will still have to
maintain software projects in the other vendor solutions and potentially also new software projects
depending on the requirements of our clients.
