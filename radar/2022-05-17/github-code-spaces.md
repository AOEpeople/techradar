[GitHub Code Spaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a very easy way to set up browser-based development environments and may be
especially suited for projects in (low) maintenance and such. Previously we had Docker Development
Environments in Assess as potential candidate in this space but we now think GitHub Code Spaces is a
much better and easier solution for us.
