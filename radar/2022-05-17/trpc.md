tRPC is a tool that provides type-safety between your front and back-ends,
hence it makes it really easy to build scalable and robust backends quickly for Node based apps.
Currently, the dominant way of making typesafe APIs is using GraphQL (it's awesome).
Since GraphQL is a query language for APIs, it doesn't take full advantage of TypeScript, it comes with excess boilerplate code and requires a lot of initial setup.
If you're already using TypeScript everywhere, you can share types directly between the client and the server without the need of any code generation.
