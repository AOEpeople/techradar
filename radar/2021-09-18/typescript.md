In the context of creating user-interfaces with React (or React-Native) and back-end applications
using Node.js, facing the proliferation of different languages used within INFO and the engineering
communities at large we decided for TypeScript as the preferred language in favor of JavaScript and
neglected Flow and others languages, to achieve a common way of working that will allow software
engineers to work on or maintain multiple codebases over multiple projects, accepting limiting the
options for teams and individual engineers to select their tools.
