When we want to incorporate AI into our solutions we prefer to use existing AI as a Service (AIaaS)
services, when possible. We focus on the AIaaS services offered by AWS and Azure but other AIaaS
services, when they are a better fit, can also be used.

This is waiting for a strategic decision on what we as INFO want as to offer to our clients
regarding data science and ML.
