An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a
greater whole. Some key benefits that we've seen from micro-frontends are, smaller, more
cohesive and maintainable code bases, more scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams and
the ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion
than was previously possible.
