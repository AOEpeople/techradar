GraphQL is a powerful way to expose an API for frontend use. 
We prefer it over REST APIs in most cases because it often increases flexibility and agility, 
depending on the context (e.g. external APIs may need to use REST for API clients' needs).

Beware
of [GraphQL misuse](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/graphql-for-server-side-resource-aggregation)
however. A mix of GraphQL and REST is also a viable solution.
