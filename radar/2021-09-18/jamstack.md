Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It
builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum
productivity. The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to
be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.
