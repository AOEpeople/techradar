[Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/v12) is an open-source GraphQL server for .NET. 
It is compatible to many GraphQL clients and tools and is really easy to setup and use. We assess it in one of our 
projects as an alternative to [GraphQL .NET](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction/).
