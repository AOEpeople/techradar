The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) is part of the Linux Foundation.
It promotes and empowers to build and run scalable applications in public or private clouds.

The CNCF supports vendor-neutral open source projects and ratifies their maturity level.
As a firm believer and supporter of open source we try to adopt open source projects
whenever possible.

The [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) gives a great overview over projects that
solve certain projects in the cloud context. We trust its evaluation of the maturity of a project.
