title:      "Shared Responsibility Model"
ring:       trial
quadrant:   methods-and-patterns

Since introducing "Platform Engineering Team" the builds, maintains and operates our Kubernetes clusters and other releated platform services the question occurs who's in charge the various tasks like keeping things up and running, applying criticial security fixed, updated software in general, keeping an eye on the bill and many more topics. We're not proposing a solution on how to split responsibilities here, but we want to raise awareness for bringing everybody together and formally discuss all responsibilities and write them down similar to (and possible extending) AWS's [shared responsibilty modell](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
