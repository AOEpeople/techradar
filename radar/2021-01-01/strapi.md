Strapi is a headless CMS, built with Javascript on Node.js. It's data-centered approach offers great flexibility for many use cases by integrating the available APIs.

Strapi's API comes in a RESTful and [GraphQL](/methods-and-patterns/graphql.html) variant.
Both perfectly support the [API-first design approach](/methods-and-patterns/api-first-design-approach.html).

Ever since the stable release version 3.0.0 from mid-2020, the CMS reached market maturity and offers a good choice for scalable headless CMSs.
