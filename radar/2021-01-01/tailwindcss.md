Tailwind CSS is a utility first css framework which heavily utilizes css classes. What seems a very "different" approach
in the beginning turns into a big "ah-ha-moment" during development and even more during build step. The classes
utilized are entirely generated based on a free to edit configuration file which outlines for example the entire design
system including states, nuances and so forth. Tailwinds high flexibility results in a very ux/design aligned set of css
classes with a fraction of writing code compared to a self built solution. For example colors, sizes, spaces etc. can
have meaningful names that are easy to remember and shared between devs and designers. This of course results in a
shared language with lesser explanation required. To sum the positive experience up Tailwind CSS has furthermore a deep
integration into the dev & build processes which means, during built time it's recognized which parts are really
necessary. This obviously lead to very small build sizes with a nearly 100% css coverage.

The deep integration and the extraordinary small build sizes were main aspects for us to choose Tailwind CSS for
resource limited industry 4.0 projects. These projects have a huge demand on a variety of interaction forms.

Tailwind helps us fast-forward to fulfil modern user expectations by reducing complexity of sophisticated industry
processes in a multi device approach.

This is what users can expect nowadays in industry processes as well because the evolution from e.g. a classic cellular
phone towards a smartphone has proven, there is still a huge potential for improvements towards usability and adaptivity
driven industry applications.
