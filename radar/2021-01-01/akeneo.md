We continue to use Akeneo with a variety of customers to store and process product data in a standardized format. It is the de facto standard for open source PIM's and therefore an integral part of our e-commerce solutions.

In the meantime, Akeneo has been continuously developed and offers many new features that further facilitate product data collection.

Regarding the stack, there was a switch to Elasticsearch and updates to more current Symfony versions. Akeneo is now also compatible with the recently released PHP 8.
