[Angular](https://angular.io/) version 18 introduces transformative features, notably the introduction of Signals and the partnership with Wiz.

Signals offer a more efficient and declarative way to handle reactivity, allowing automatic UI updates with changing data, thus reducing boilerplate and enhancing maintainability.

Standalone components, further refined in Angular 18, reduce module dependency and complexity, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. Enhancements in monorepo management improve the organization and sharing of components across projects, supporting large-scale applications.

Wiz is a Google internal framework used for performance-critical apps like Google Search. The merge with Wiz brings advanced profiling, debugging, and performance optimization tools from Wiz into Angular, streamlining workflows and improving application performance. This collaboration aims to boost developer productivity and efficiency by combining Angular's framework robustness with Wiz's powerful tools.

Overall, Angular 18's advancements in reactivity and tooling, along with the Wiz integration, significantly boost performance, usability, and developer productivity, solidifying Angular's status as a leading framework for modern web development.
