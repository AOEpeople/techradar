### Adopting GitHub Copilot

We've adopted AI Assisted Programming to enhance our overall efficiency and product quality, with [GitHub Copilot](/tools/github-copilot/) serving as our primary tool for this purpose.

Guidelines for its usage have been established, and we continuously refine our practices by sharing best practices and insights within our communities.

The use of [GitHub Copilot](/tools/github-copilot/) is currently project-based and requires customer consent. While utilizing it, we remain mindful of potential risks and actively work to mitigate them.

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

- **Code Quality and Reliability**: Validate and review generated code before integration into the project. Manual code reviews and testing should remain fundamental to the development process.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Conduct thorough security assessments and penetration testing to identify and rectify potential weaknesses. Stay updated with security best practices and ensure AI-generated code aligns with secure coding guidelines.
- **Intellectual Property Concerns**: Scrutinize licensing and usage terms of AI tools. Exercise caution when incorporating code snippets from external sources and ensure compliance with relevant licenses.
- **Data Privacy**: Review data access and privacy policies of AI tools meticulously. Prevent inadvertent exposure or sharing of sensitive or confidential information with third parties.
