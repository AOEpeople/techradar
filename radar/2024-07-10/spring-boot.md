For new microservices in a cloud environment, Spring Boot is still one of our defaults. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, we at AOE especially like the following features:

- Full integration with the [Kotlin language](/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin/)
- Excellent plugins and libraries for supporting GraphQL ([DGS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/), [Spring for GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql))
- Easy-to-use and powerful provision of RESTful services, including support for [OpenAPI](/tools/open-api/)
- Support for many cache providers, including distributed and replicated caches
- Metrics and monitoring support with [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/)
