[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript environments. It includes a JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager. It is designed to optimize the performance and development experience of JavaScript and TypeScript applications. Bun provides fast startup times, native TypeScript support, and improved dependency management.

We are very curious whether Bun is suitable for our projects and fulfills our requirements with regard to professional environments.
