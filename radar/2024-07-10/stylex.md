Facebook has released [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/), an open-source JavaScript syntax and compiler for styling web apps. It combines the developer experience of [CSS-in-JS](/methods-and-patterns/css-in-js/) libraries with the performance and scalability of static CSS using compile-time tools.

It supports frameworks like [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react/) and [Angular](/languages-and-frameworks/angular/). Styles are defined using an object syntax and `create()` API, and can be conditionally applied within components.

### Key Features
- **Atomic CSS**: Minimizes CSS output
- **Type-Safe**: Ensures reliability in large projects
- **Composable**: Facilitates reusable components
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed
- **Scalable and Predictable**: Ideal for large projects

We are eager to evaluate how well StyleX will integrate into our projects.
