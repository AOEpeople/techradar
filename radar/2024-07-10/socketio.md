[Socket.IO](https://socket.io) is a library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers based on websockets. It simplifies complex tasks involved in real-time data transfer and supports features like automatic reconnection and fallback to different transports if needed. This makes it ideal for applications such as chat apps, live notifications, and collaborative tools. Its event-based architecture and support for namespaces and rooms make it versatile and scalable. We are currently evaluating if its usage could be beneficial for some of our projects.
