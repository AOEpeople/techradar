[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) is a feature-rich and highly versatile [CSS-in-JS](/methods-and-patterns/css-in-js/) library that generates CSS at build time. We are using it successfully in one of our projects, where it has proven to deliver a great developer experience and solid performance.

It is framework-agnostic, and unlike [Stylex](/languages-and-frameworks/stylex/) or Vanilla Extract, it provides JSX-specific features such as the `styled` function and style props. This makes it especially powerful when working with component-driven frameworks like React.

### Key Features:

- Compatible with [React Server Components](/methods-and-patterns/react-server-components/)
- No performance drawbacks compared to runtime libraries
- Highly versatile:
  - Recipes and variants (similar to Stitches)
  - Framework-agnostic architecture
  - `styled` function for creating UI components
  - Style props inspired by styled-system
  - Utility classes like Tailwind
- W3C-compliant design system with tokens and utilities support
- Fully typed API for excellent developer ergonomics

With comprehensive documentation and active community support from the Chakra UI Team, Panda CSS has become a valuable part of our frontend stack and is a strong recommendation for projects requiring robust styling solutions.
