[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) now offers Component Testing, allowing developers to run isolated tests on UI components directly in real browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It works seamlessly with popular frameworks such as [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react/), [Vue](/languages-and-frameworks/vue/), and [Angular](languages-and-frameworks/angular/), and integrates smoothly with build tools like [Vite](/tools/vite/) and [Webpack](https://techradar.aoe.com/tools/webpack/).
Component Testing is significantly faster than traditional end-to-end tests and provides a more realistic and robust alternative to conventional unit tests for frontend components, while also making it easy to incorporate [Visual Regression Tests for Frontend Developers](methods-and-patterns/visual-regression-tests/) to ensure both functional correctness and visual consistency over time.

Playwright also supports test sharding now, which splits test execution across multiple machines or processes to speed up large test suites. By running tests in parallel shards, developers can significantly reduce overall test time, making continuous integration faster and more efficient â€” especially in projects with extensive component libraries.
