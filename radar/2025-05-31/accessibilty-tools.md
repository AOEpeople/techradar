Accessibility testing tools help ensure that web applications are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. 
 
[Eye-Able](https://eye-able.com/de) provides developer-focused tools for building accessible Web applications from the ground up. Beyond its user-facing assistive features, Eye-Able provides an accessibility audit toolkit that scans websites for WCAG violations and usability barriers. Developers get actionable insights directly into their workflow, making it easier to identify and fix problems early.

[axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), developed by Deque Systems, is another leading accessibility testing tool. It automates the detection of accessibility issues through a browser extension, CLI, or JavaScript library. axe highlights violations of WCAG standards and provides clear, actionable recommendations for remediation, making it an essential tool for developers looking to integrate accessibility directly into their development workflow.

Combining axe with [Playwright](/tools/playwright) brings automated accessibility testing into the end-to-end testing workflow. With Playwright's real browser automation and axe's powerful accessibility engine, developers can run accessibility audits as part of their testing for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. This integration enables early detection of issues in dynamic applications, ensuring accessibility compliance throughout the development lifecycle.
