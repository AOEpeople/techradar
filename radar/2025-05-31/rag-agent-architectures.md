### From Prototypes to Production: Modular RAG & Agent Development

Advanced AI systems go far beyond prompt hacks and quick demos.
**Modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agent-based architectures** are key patterns for building reliable, extensible, and context-aware AI applications.

Professional RAG and agent development means addressing:

- Modular context pipelines
- Multi-step reasoning and planning
- Tool orchestration and memory
- Testing, safety, and observability

### The AOE AI Radar

Moving from a working prototype to a production-grade AI system requires architectural thinking and reusable design. Tooling, context strategies, and evaluation must become part of your delivery pipeline.

We have launched a dedicated spin-off of our Tech Radar to cover the fast-moving ecosystem around professional AI Agents, advanced RAG architectures, and LLMOps practices.

 **The [AOE AI Radar](https://ai-radar.aoe.com/) guides you through the landscape of tools, frameworks, and models.**

 It is organized into:

- **Patterns & Architectures** – Design strategies for agents, RAG, tool usage, and memory
- **Frameworks** – Tools to build scalable, maintainable AI applications
- **Models & Platforms** – LLMs and vector platforms powering your systems
- **Evaluation & Observability** – Measure quality, safety, and performance
- **Data & Storage** – Handle sources, features, chunks, embeddings
- **Other Tools** – Workflow, low-code and cross-cutting utilities
