## AI & Agent Frameworks – Building Blocks for LLM-Driven Applications

With the rise of generative AI and LLM-based systems, a new generation of **agent frameworks**, such as LlamaIndex, LangGraph and many more has emerged to support the development of complex, multi-step, tool-using AI applications.

These frameworks provide building blocks to orchestrate LLMs, tools, memory, and context – enabling everything from simple assistants to autonomous agents.

## Why it matters

While basic prompting is easy, building maintainable and extensible AI applications that met quality expectations is not trivial. Agent frameworks help:

- Structure reasoning and decision-making
- Integrate external tools (APIs, databases, functions)
- Manage memory and context windows
- Enable traceability, observability, and evaluation

## Conclusion and Further Reading

Agent frameworks are essential enablers for moving from experiments to structured, reusable AI components. Choosing the right framework impacts scalability, maintainability, and team productivity.
