State management is a key part of building modern web applications. Two lightweight yet powerful libraries that simplify this task are Zustand and Jotai, both offering modern alternatives to heavier solutions like [Redux](/languages-and-frameworks/redux/).

 [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) is a minimalistic state management library that creates global stores with a simple API and no boilerplate. It uses features like hooks and embraces mutability under the hood, while making state updates predictable and fast. Zustand stores are flexible — they can hold any kind of data, including functions and objects — and they work seamlessly in [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react/) applications without the need for context providers. Thanks to built-in support for features like persisted state, selectors, and middleware, Zustand scales from small to large applications effortlessly.

[Jotai](https://jotai.org/), by contrast, introduces a primitive and atomic approach to state management. Inspired by the principles of Recoil, Jotai allows developers to manage state through small, composable atoms — units of state that can be shared and combined across components. This atom-based model provides fine-grained reactivity, so components only re-render when the atoms they use change. Jotai is designed to be minimal and explicit, with first-class support for derived state, asynchronous atoms, and TypeScript. It fits naturally into component-driven development and encourages co-located state, making it easy to reason about and scale.

Compared to traditional libraries, both Zustand and Jotai prioritize simplicity, minimal bundle size, and modern React integration.
