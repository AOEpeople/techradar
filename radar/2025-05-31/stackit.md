[STACKIT](https://stackit.de/) is a sovereign cloud platform operated by the Schwarz Group, with infrastructure based in Germany and Austria. It offers IaaS, managed Kubernetes, and platform services such as databases and Cloud Foundry. Built on open technologies, STACKIT is designed for full GDPR compliance.

The platform targets privacy-conscious workloads in regulated industries and the public sector. Key advantages include transparent pricing, open standards, and free data egress, which help reduce vendor lock-in risks.

While STACKIT's service portfolio is still maturing, it is a strong alternative to US hyperscalers for organizations that prioritize digital sovereignty, operational transparency, and data locality within the EU.
