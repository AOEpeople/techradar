Tailwind CSS has continued to be a vital part of our frontend development toolkit. The recent update to version 4.0 has moved all of the theme configuration into CSS variables. We appreciate this update since it further increases the reusability of design tokens, can allow for theme changes during runtime and fully moves Tailwind into CSS.

Finally, comparing Tailwind CSS to CSS-in-JS solutions, we've experienced that it does not present the same pitfalls when integrating with React Server Components. While some CSS-in-JS frameworks still cause compilation issues when used inside a Server Component, due to their reliance on client-side JavaScript, Tailwind CSS does not have this problem due to its static nature and being purely CSS-based.
