By the end of June 2025, a new EU directive—the European Accessibility Act (EAA)—will come into full effect, requiring that digital products and services meet specific accessibility standards. This law emphasizes the need to ensure inclusivity for users with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

In light of this, we recommend **adopting accessibility as a core design and development practice**. Rather than treating accessibility as an afterthought or compliance checkbox, it should be embedded in all phases of product development: from user research and design to coding, testing, and documentation.

Adopting accessibility improves usability for all users, reduces legal risk, and supports ethical and inclusive product development.
Teams should familiarize with WCAG 2.2 criteris, for example: use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, ensure keyboard navigability.

The use of [Accessibility Tools](/tools/accessibilty-tools) also helps to unterstand and build more inclusive websites.

This is not just about meeting legal obligations—it's about building better, more inclusive technology.
