By the end of June 2025, a new EU directive—the European Accessibility Act (EAA)—will come into full effect, requiring digital products and services to meet specific accessibility standards. This law emphasizes the importance of inclusion for users with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

In light of this, we recommend **adopting accessibility as a core design and development practice**. Rather than treating accessibility as an afterthought or a compliance checkbox, it should be embedded in all phases of product development: from user research and design to coding, testing, and documentation.

Adopting accessibility improves usability for all users, reduces legal risks, and supports ethical and inclusive product development. Teams should familiarize themselves with WCAG 2.2 criteria, such as using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigability.

The use of [Accessibility Tools](/tools/accessibility-tools) also helps to understand and build more inclusive websites.

This is not merely about fulfilling legal requirements; it’s about designing technology that is better and more inclusive for everyone.
