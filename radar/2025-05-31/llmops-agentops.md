### Operating LLM-Centric AI Systems

As generative AI systems evolve from simple prompts to complex applications, **LLMOps** and **AgentOps** emerge as key disciplines for ensuring **production-readiness**, **reliability**, and **observability**.

This includes systems built on LLMs with tools, memory, retrieval (RAG), and multi-step reasoning – commonly referred to as **agents**.

### Why it matters

The transition from prototype to production-ready application with LLM is not trivial:

- Prompt and workflow versioning
- Orchestration of tools and memory
- Monitoring quality, cost, and drift
- Guardrails and safety enforcement

**LLMOps & AgentOps** define the patterns and toolchains to manage this complexity.

### Conclusion and Details

LLMOps & AgentOps provide the operational backbone for scaling generative AI. Teams adopting LLMs should treat operational workflows as first-class citizens – just like code.

A rapidly growing ecosystem supports these workflows and patterns.
