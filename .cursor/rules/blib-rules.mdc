# About
This is a repository content for our AOE techradar.


The Tech Radar provides an overview of different technologies, including languages, frameworks,
tools, and patterns, as well as platforms, that we consider 'new or noteworthy.' The radar does not
cover all established technologies; instead, it focuses on items that have recently gained
significance or undergone changes. Items previously featured in the radar are not listed on the
homepage but remain available in the complete overview and search.

The audience are software engineers, developers and in general all people interested in technologies.

The content is stored in the folder "radar" inside a folder with a certain date.
